# Virtualenv Burrito #

With one command, have a working virtualenv + virtualenvwrapper environment.

## Usage ##

    curl -s https://github.com/brainsik/virtualenv-burrito/raw/master/virtualenv-burrito.sh | bash

## Why ##

To get Python coders coding quickly.

Virtualenv Burrito was inspired by Pycon sprinters who wasted time getting
virtualenv setup so they could start hacking on code. It's depressingly
complicated to quickly setup the wonderful virtualenv + virtualenvwrapper
environment. Depending on your system you may end up dicking around with
setuptools, distribute, virtualenv, virtulenvwrapper, .bashrc, PyPI, apt-get,
MacPorts, and more.

## Caveat emptor ##

This simple script is meant for people who do not have virtualenv installed.
